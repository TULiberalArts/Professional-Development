**The CLA Professional Development (PD) Team remains available and fully committed to offering you the best career services possible for the remainder of the semester and beyond.** The only noticeable change is in how we'll serve and meet with you. You will still go on Handshake to schedule one-on-one appointments, but you have three new options to select from:

- **Online via Zoom.** You'll be given a Zoom link which you will click on at your scheduled appointment time to join to meet with a PD team member.
- **Phone.** You'll provide your phone number in the description box on Handshake when making an appointment and we'll call you at the given time.
- **Email.** If you are asking for us to review your materials (resume, cover letter, etc.) you will email them to us.
