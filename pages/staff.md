A proud and enthusiastic Temple alum, Anne is thrilled to bring her years of experience and passion for the liberal arts to the professional development team. With over 25 years devoted to the nonprofit, business and higher education sectors, working in a wide range of capacities, Anne is well equipped to help lead student professional development initiatives in College of Liberal Arts.

Upon completion of her bachelor’s degree in Government and Sociology from St. Mary’s College, Notre Dame, Indiana, she spent several years working on local policy initiatives in Washington, D.C. and New York City, and managing an employment program for homeless youth in her hometown of Chicago.  Eager to get back to the east coast and interested in pursuing additional training and education in management and organizational practices, Anne pursued her MBA at Temple while overseeing training programs for entrepreneurs in the Temple Small Business Development Center. Post MBA and three children later, Anne joined the Fox Management Consulting team to help develop and grow their innovative experiential education model linking MBA students with nonprofit boards and other opportunities helping them apply their academics to real world business problems and people. Excited to reconnect with her liberal arts roots and help undergraduate students in their career development journey, Anne feels privileged to be part of the CLA professional development team. When not at Temple Anne stays busy with her husband and children and their 2.5 year old Golden Retriever, Sully. She serves as board chair on the Greene Street Friends School’s board of trustees, and is very slowly working on a second master’s degree in Temple’s College of Education.
