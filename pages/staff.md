Annabelle was born and raised in the Bronx, NY. Being born to immigrant, Ghanaian parents in such an urban area gave her a different outlook on life and the value of education. After her high school graduation in 2016, Annabelle decided to attend Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. Her choice to attend that college was influenced highly by the large amount of financial aid that was given to her. Ultimately, she was unhappy at the institution and felt out of place because of the lack of diversity and rural area. She followed her gut and transitioned to Temple University in the fall of 2018 as a junior.  Within a couple of months, Annabelle became a Career Peer Advisor for the College of Liberal Arts and joined the executive board for NAACP as the Press and Publicity chair. She enjoys playing basketball, listening to R&B/Hip hop, and speaking on issues that marginalize African Americans. Her career interest is to be a political analyst and produce her own narratives on societal issues of minorities. “Listen, life is tough and has many routes. But, you have to do what makes you happy for YOU, not anyone else. Be yourself and be great because this world needs more light” said Ms. Menla.
